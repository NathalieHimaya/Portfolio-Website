<h3>Info:</h3>
<p>
 This portfolio was an example shown on YouTube. 
 I started this website design as an intro to HTML and CSS to get back into coding.
 Though the project isn't finished,
 I've moved on to a separate project to determine my knowns and unknowns when it comes to coding in this language.
